My main goal is to game, movie, animation, and special effects industry to enjoy the convenience of automatical modelling using the power of artificial intelligence, so they are able to focus more on design. Our service can custom to do different typeS of modelling tasks by switching between pre-defined modes. We also provide massive ready-to-use 3d models that generated from our periodic mega-scans activities. All of this will save time and efforts of our customers. This website serve as introduction of our company, our team, our services and types of our 3d models.

## Plugins
List what plugins you used with their URLs and a very brief description of what you used them for.
It should be obvious from this how/where they are used on your site.

## Reflection and Insights
Describe your experience using the two different CMSs.<br>
What have you learned through this assignment regarding the different systems?


It was pleasant to experience and explore using Content Management Systems to create actual websites. It was quite different from writing codes on IDE, as these CMSs provide features that are able to be used repeatedly. Moreover, features such as themes and galleries are highly customizable plus somes have many amazing templates on the internet, thus you are able to develop a graphically attractive website with less time and effort. Also combine the uses of customized css and javascript files, there are so many things that can be done.


Using extensions and plugins, can save lots of time setting up a working directory and writing scripts to connect and use external css and javascript libraries. What used to be hours of work can be replaced by a few single clicks in minutes. Since there are so many plugins you are able to select a good one from many, or select the one that matches the style of your website. From this point of view of CMS users, this indeed makes website programming more efficient, and users can focus on designing the website and its features and contents which takes the quality of the website into another level.


After experiencing the both CMS platforms (wordpress and joomla), I feel wordpress is much user friendly to use, you are not even required to understand programming, and joomla is more comprehensive and gives more choices of customizing the code itself. However, since wordpress communities are very active and joomla communities are not, wordpress have many more plugins and templates to select and free to use also you are easy to find any features that match your needs. On the other hand, Joomla communities are almost dead, less helpful tutorials, less free plugins, unable to change many things using the coder editors, which means you have to edit the code of CMS itself. During the development, I encountered problems of changing the colors and logo of the themes, wordpress editor provides an easy solution to that, but for joomla, you have to change the template files itself and even the php.


In wordpress they provide lots of templates modules that have layout already, you only to add the content and do some adjustion on font size and color. This is quite convient so you do not to do repeated tasks to manual copy paste the layout, however since is layout fixed and pre-defined you canâ€™t make adjustment on existing layout template but write custom html codes instead which is quite inflexible. For joomla is the opposite, you only have the a custom modules, you do not have any predefined layout, therefore is more flexiable than wordpress but still canâ€™t insert css and javasript codes, and have weired text filter that filter some useful modules such as iframe for youtube videos.


During my development I have meet upload size problem, the default limit for upload size is quite small, this make development very difficult especally for joomla, since upload size only affect images upload in wordpress you can search and install plugins at once, but for joomla it affect images upload and plugin install as you need to download puglins from a website and upload to server to installed. I use a plugin to solve this problem on wordpress, however it does not work on joomla. After few attemps I bypass the problem by upload plugins to server folder directory then installed from the folder. I learn sometimes when you meet a very hard problems the best options may not be solve the problems but bypass it with alternatives.


Both CMS platforms are lack of features to display images as a sliceshow, therefore a gallery plugins is needed for both CMS. Wordpress is easy as it have many plugins, then I have found one good enough and free to use. This problem become tricky when come to joomla, I found one free plugins, however the plugin seem didnâ€™t fully tested and do not work for me. After few attemples I begin to find javascript library with code example on internet, I simplify the code, break the into parts, insert to php website template file and custom modules seperatly, after few debugging it work fine. During this process I learn a lot about the implement code of joomla and understand how to read php. From this example, we can see joomla is really outdated, and not user friendly to use, even through is more flexiable to wordpress which make you embed raw codes more conveniently.


The last challenges I have is relate to making different CMS display the similar web pages. Since default background color, text color, text font and text size even the layout is different, I was having difficulties to achieve my goal. I learn use chrome inspect feature to check style and other specific configuration of one CMS and try to impletment similar text or color or size on the other CMS. Inline css and bootstrap also w3chool help lots I adapt their codes and try to implement on CMS and this save me many times and efforts, so I am able to foucs on design. During the process I learn a lots about flex and grip, there are my primary tools to make good layout on Joomla. I use inline css combine with them until my goals is achieved. I spend 3 times efforts on joomla than wordpress, since wordpress have code-free and userfriendly interface there are many options you could use one of features interface to solve the problems, but this did not work for joomla, for joomla I often need to modify the actual backend files this include php templates, long reference css files, and creating new directory to bypass or solve the problems.
